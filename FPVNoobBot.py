    - The drone is flipping, spinning, jumping, or disarming right after arming or throttle-up.
    - The user is seeking help or trying to fix the problem.
    - It happens at or immediately after takeoff (not mid-flight or after flying normally).
    - It is unintentional (not a trick, flip mode, or freestyle).

    Answer "No" if:
    - The drone flies normally first before flipping or crashing.
    - The flip/spin is part of a trick or a stunt.
    - The post is vague or you're unsure.
    - The user is not asking for help.
